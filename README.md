# XnatDUI - Xnat Download-Upload UI

This is an interface to talk to [XNAT](https://www.xnat.org/), a web based -open-source neuroimaging repository. This was built out of need for some specific functionality required for [NIDA NRB](https://irp.drugabuse.gov/nrb/index.php) and after months of evolving, testing, requirements gathering, suggestions, critiques and comments, it is turning into a full fledged, fast and dependable Download-Upload-Export User Interface for Xnat.

This is still under construction, and not at a stage I envision it to be. But I will try to get to that stage as and when time permits. 

For any problems, comments and suggestions, please send me an email or start an Issue here on github and I will try to get to it when possible.

It is built completely in python 3.5 and has not been tested for any version below 3.5 . 
It has been tested for Linux and Windows machines for Downloading. I'll push the Upload and Export functions soon to the online repo. Tweaking and testing a few things at the moment.
